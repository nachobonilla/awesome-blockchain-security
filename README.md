# Awesome Blockchain Security

The purpose of this document is to gather public information on vulnerabilities introduced on Blockchains node software. 

## Bitcoin Core
- Language: C++

### Inflation bug
* https://bitcoincore.org/en/2018/09/20/notice/
* https://medium.com/@awemany/600-microseconds-b70f87b0b2a6

### Leaf Node weakness in Bitcoin Merkle Tree Design

This document describes a weakness in Bitcoin Design that reduces the security of SPV proofs and therefore SPV Wallets.

* https://bitslog.com/2018/06/09/leaf-node-weakness-in-bitcoin-merkle-tree-design/

### RPC service enable connections from other process

It is possible for another user on the system to quietly bind the IPv4 localhost port, and forward requests to the IPv6 localhost port, intercepting the request, response, and authentication credentials.
Note: This is a super low vulnerability, but it is good practice to add this kind of things in documentations.

### Combined output Overflow

On August 15 2010, it was discovered that block 74638 contained a transaction that created 184,467,440,737.09551616 bitcoins for three different addresses.
Two addresses received 92.2 billion bitcoins each, and whoever solved the block got an extra 0.01 BTC that did not exist prior to the transaction. This was possible because the code used for checking transactions before including them in a block didn't account for the case of outputs so large that they overflowed when summed.

### Network-wide DoS using malleable signatures in alerts

An attacker build new signatures at a high rate by changing the signature of an alert still in circulation and therefore increasing dramatically the number of valid alerts spreading across the network. This leads to halting all Bitcoin nodes in the network by RAM exhaustion in approximately 4 hours.

* https://hackerone.com/reports/462442

### Zero-amount miner TX + RingCT allows monero wallet to receive arbitrary amount of monero

By mining a specially crafted block, that still passes daemon verification an attacker can create a miner transaction that appears to the wallet to include sum of XMR picked by the attacker. This can be exploited to steal money from exchanges.

## Grin 
- Language: Rust

Node security audit

Most vulnerabilities described in the report can be grouped into the following categories, and special care should be taken to prevent these patterns from appearing again in the codebase:

    1- Directory path traversal leading to remote code execution
    2- Memory corruption vulnerabilities in unsafe code blocks located in third-party libraries
    3- Denial of service caused by Rust panics, expects, and unhandled error conditions
    4- Synchronization process denial of service caused by out-of-order P2P messages
    5- Storage-based denial of service caused by failure to clean up temporary files
    6- Node censorship through node ban feature abuse
    7- Failure to ban ill-behaved nodes leading to CPU-based denial of service
    8- Lack of validation of orphan blocks
    9- Insecure file handling leading to local privilege escalation
